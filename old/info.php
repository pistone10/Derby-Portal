      </h1>
      <p>Basic Expectations</p>
      <li>Work closely with the Jam Timer<br />
        <li>Know basic time out procedures - How long team time outs will be,when period clock begins after a time out, etc.<li>Follows Jam Timers Signaling of who (team or Officials)  has taken the time out and displaying it on the scoreboard.
      <li>Be regularly making eye contact with the Jam Timer, especially during time outs- checking the clock is correct with their clocks.      <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Work closely with Scorekeepers</strong><br />
        <br />                          
      <li>Update scores as given to you by the scorekeeper. DO NOT take the reported score from the jam refs and bypass the scorekeeper.<br />
        
        <br /><br />
      </li>
      <h1>
      </p>
      <h1>Scorekeeper</h1>
      Basic Expectations<br />
      
     <br />
     <strong>Works closely with the Jam Refs</strong><br />
        
               <li>Refs will be requested to signal the Jammers Number to score keepers before each jam starts.
               <li>Score keepers should give a ‘thumbs up’ signal back to the ref to confirm they got the jammers number.
               <li>Watching Jam refs as they report passes.<li>Understand that some refs MAY report ‘No Pass’ as a neck slice hand signal, and others may not. 
                Watch for the Jam Ref to signal for lead jam or not lead. If you do not see either of these, then it is most likely because the jammer has not completed their initial pass. This is also confirmed if the Jam Ref holds up no score at the end of the jam. NOTE: NO SCORE IS DIFFERENT THAN ZERO POINTS.
               <li>Hold up the score reported to you by the Jam Ref back to them- ideally they will nod and confirm.
          
      <li>Discuss before bouts with your Jam Refs if they want you to give back up on scoring.
      <li> You will remain with your Jam Ref for the entire bout, switching team together.
        
       <br />
       <strong><br />
       Working with Scoreboard</strong><br />
        
     Report scores per pass to the Scoreboard Operator.<br />
      <li>Check the displayed score for your team at the end of each jam <br />              
      <li>Check that displayed jams on the board match yours.
                
      <br />
                <strong><br />
                Working with fellow Scorekeeper</strong><br />
      <li> Switch sheets and check each others math at the half.
      When a star pass happens, move down to the next line, as though it were a new jam, write ‘sp’ in the jam# slot, and record who the new jammer is.  Start passes at the same place the old jammer left off, do not start over. <br />              
      <li>Rule of thumb - If your Jam ref was holding up a score BEFORE the jam ended, you should write that down for the appropriate pass, and then write down a ‘0’ for the next pass, as Jam refs should only report scores for passes at the end of a pass, or end of a jam.  If that pass is over, she is on a new pass, and that pass is 0.  This helps when your paperwork is compared to Line Up.<br />
      <li>Box points/Off the Track points/Ghost Points are not mandatory, but encouraged.<br />
                
                
        <br /><br />
        <h1>Penalty Box</h1>
        <h3>Box Manager      </h3>
      Basic Expectations      <br />
      <br />
      <li>Timing Jammer’s penalty minutes<br />
      <li>Managing over all functions of the box as a whole - helping time for blockers (if needed/requested from other box NSOs) helping wave skaters to the appropriate side of the box, etc<br />
      <li>Enforcing policies/rules of skaters leaving the box during timeouts/ managers coming into the box to talk, etc.<br />
      <li>Managing the queue of skaters needing to go back to the box<br />
      <li>Skaters will check in with you, and only the manager should wave them off<br />
      <li>Manager will write the skaters number on the board and hold it up working with the refs to get her back to the box<br />
      <li>Communicating when a skater has left the box early<br />
      <li>Will write the skater team colour/number and the amount remaining on the board, hold it up for refs to see till skater reports back.<br />
      <li>Box paperwork - not mandatory, but can be used if you choose to.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>Box Timer</h3>
      Basic Expectations<br />
      <br />
      <li>Timing blocker penalty minutes<br />
      <li>Helping wave skaters to the appropriate side of the box<br />
      <li>Help manage the queue.<br />
      <li>All Box NSOs will use protocol of <strong>&quot;color, #, Stand&quot;</strong> at 10 seconds and <strong>&quot;color,#,done&quot; </strong>when time is completed.<br />
      <li>If a skater asks for how much time remaining you may tell them, or show the watch.<br />
      <li>No other information should be given to skaters - why they are in the box, what your astrology sign is, etc.<br />
      <li>If a skater sits in the ‘wrong’ side of the box or wrong seat, you may begin timing them, but inform them to move to the right seat<br />
      <li>At 10 seconds, a skater MUST stand.  If they do not visibly stand, you may inform them you are no longer timing them until they are clearly standing. <br />
      <li>You will stay with the same team you were timing for the whole bout.  You will not switch teams.       <br />
        <h1>&nbsp;</h1>
        <h1>Line Up Tracking</h1>
        Basic Expectations<br />
        
        <br />
      <li>BASIC line up consists of JUST writing the skater # of skaters on the track in that jam and position they are playing each jam.<br />
      <li>If a star pass happens, go down a line, as though starting a new jam, write ‘SP’ in the jam # and record the new jammer.<br />
          <br /> 
          Advanced Expectations<br />
          
      <br />      
      <li>Advanced Line up consists of basic, PLUS recording the number of PASSES the OPPOSING jammer is making, and on what pass # Skaters on the team you are tracking are going in and out of the box. <br />
      <li>So if you were LU Tracking for the Black Team, you would write down who the blockers, pivot and jammer are for the black team before the jam starts.<br />
      <li>You would then immediately start tracking the WHITE jammers passes.  You do this on the block of numbers on the far right side of the sheet.  Cross off a number AFTER she has completed that pass.  The lowest number that is not crossed off should be the pass she was on as the jam was called.<br />
      <li>If a BLACK blocker, say Black 24, goes to the box on the WHITE jammers 3rd (total, not just scoring) pass, you would write on the top left box next to her name a 3.  She gets out on the 6th pass of the WHITE jammer, you would write ‘6’ on the box to the right (next to the box you wrote ‘3’).<br />
      <li>IF a skater stays in the box during the 30 seconds between jams, you leave the outbox for that jam blank.  You would then carry her number down to the next jam, and write a ‘0’ in the IN box, showing she was there in between jams,and write the pass number she exits in the out box of the next jam. <br />
          
          
          <br />
          GENERAL things for line up<br />
          
      <br />      
      <li>I want line up to have the best vantage point possible to see what helps them do their job best.  They can sit wherever they like as long as they are accessible to communicate with quickly.  Many line up trackers favor sitting near the penalty box or near the jam line depending on the layout of the track.<br />      
      <li>If Line up is true, and you say the White jammer made a total of 6 passes, and on her 3rd pass black blocker 2 went into the box and didnt get out until White jammers 5th pass, then on white jammers 4th pass - I should see a box point (if Score has elected to do box points.), or at least I know that if I see 1 point written down, chances are good a box point was missed.<br />
      <li>If line up tells me a team had 4 skaters in the box in jam 8, I should be able to look at the penalty sheets for that team and see 4 ‘majors’ or 4th minors and confirm this. <br />
      <li>If a Penalty tracker says a skater is due to foul out on this trip to the box, the LI paperwork should confirm if she ever reported and served that time.<br />
          
          <br />Additional tips for Line Up<br />
          <br />
      <li>Once the jam has started, the jammer is on pass one, even if the jammer whistle hasn't blown or she is in the penalty box. (The only exception would be if her team has failed to field a jammer?)<br />
          
          
          <br />
          Be careful for common errors:<br />
          <br />
      <li>Enter the blockers first, because it's easier to figure out who the jammer and the pivot are once the jam starts.<br />
      <li> Don't mix up the jammer and the pivot. This can happen if you are near the penalty box because the jammer will be to your left but is on the right side of the sheet.<br />
      <li> Once you enter the line ups, double check them! There are often replacements right before the jam starts, especially if there was a time out.<br />
      <li> Line up trackers should talk to each other a lot! Line ups require a lot of concentration and it's easy to space out for a second and miss something. By talking to each other, you can help keep focused, as well as assist each other during busy moments. <br />
      <li> If possible, have a roster of skater numbers nearby to help you accurately record what the skater's officiating numbers are.

        <h1>Penalty Trackers</h1>
        <p>Basic Expectations<br /><br />
              
          Work closely with ALL refs<br />
        </p>
        Jam Refs<br />
            
          note the jammer for your team each jam, and give the number of minors that jammer has to the jam ref.<br />
            
          I’d like to see, but do not require, the pt’s to hold up the # of minors towards the jam refs until the jammers are released on the 2nd set of whistles.<br />
            
        Inside Pack refs<br />
            
          As you have a call communicated to you from the refs, record it on your sheet and confirm with a LOUD voice.  ‘Got it’, or repeating the call, etc is fine.  As long as the ref has a verbal and visible cue you got the communication.<br />
          When a skater has her 4th minor you will yell it to the refs, AND OR give that to the wrangler and they will communicate it to the ref crew.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Outside Pack refs<br />
              
          Depending on what kind of wrangler your team is using, you may or may not be focusing on the outside.  If you are using a ‘running’ wrangler, you will be looking at the opr’s and owb’s often.  when you get a call from them be sure to do a visible confirmation.  OWBs get a THUMBS UP to let them know you have the call. <br />
              
          <br />Poodles<br />
              
          When a skaters is picking up their intentional 4th  minor by lining up outside of the pivot-jammer line, penalty trackers should notice, and if needed alert a ref.  Confirm to the refs that she does have 3 minors.  I recommend verbage similar to ‘Black 33, CONFIRMED!’<br />
          <br /> If she does not, then communicate that as well. <br />
          <br />PENALTY TRACKERS DO NOT SWITCH AT THE HALF. You will remain with your team.<br />
              
          <br />
              
          Communicate with the Inside White Board<br />
        </p>
        <p>Every thing you write on your paper should in some way be communicated to the IWB. <br />
        </p>
        <p>Minors - “Blue 33, 2’nd minor’.  By saying which number of minor they are on you are checking the board every time it’s changing.<br />
          <br />Majors - “Blue 33, Elbow, Major, That’s her 4th”  IWB needs to know what the major is as they will be writing the penalty code for it on the major side.  Again noting the checking the # at the end.<br />
          <br />In a perfect world, the IWB should be checked about every 7-10 jams at least. I recommend, but do not require, having the IWB run down the list of minors per skater, out loud, and the PT following along and confirming.  Do not say the skaters #’s each time, but as your sheet is in the same order as the IWB, just say the number of minors down the list. Do the same for majors (do not need to check the types of majors recorded are correct)<br />
              
              
          <br />
          <strong>Communicate with the wrangler<br />
                
          </strong><br />Depending on the type of wrangler you use will depend on how you communicate with them. <br />
              
          <br />
          <strong>Running Wrangler (where the wrangler is rarely next to you, or within immediate distance from you, but rather is literally running along side the refs at almost all times)</strong><br />
              
          <br />In this instance your wranglers will be almost a single penalty tracker, who is funneling calls from the refs to the trackers in the middle.  You will confirm to your wrangler that you got the call from them and move on to talking to the IWB. <br />
          <br />When you have a running wrangler, you will shift your focus to the outside whiteboards and oprs more, as the wrangler is not able to concentrate on them. <br />
              
          <strong><br />
        Home Based Wrangler (a hybrid of running and stationary, where the wrangler may kind of be a ‘tether ball’ bouncing back and forth in a line behind the IWB, but still in moderate range of the PT’s.) </strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In this instance you will use your wranger as a strong back up.  They will help pick up calls you may have missed, watch the outside refs and boards, and be aggressive of catching calls when multiples are coming in.  They may also carry a small ‘3 board’ with them to help them keep track of who has 3 minors. <br />
          <br />The home based wrangler should be used to focus on the OPR and OWB.  If you see a call coming in from either you should tap your wrangler and say ‘OUTSIDE’ and continue moving with the iprs and pack and picking up those calls as the wrangler picks up outside calls.<br />
          <br />When you have a home based wrangler it becomes very important to CONFIRM loudly to them so they know you got the call directly from the refs.  Also use them primarily to pass on 4th minors to refs, poodles, etc.<br />
              
          <br />
          <strong>Stationary Wrangler (Standing directly behind the IWB, and inbetween the PTs)<br />
                
          </strong><br />With Stationary Wranglers they are truly only back ups.  They will primarily focus on outside calls, and some moderate calls on the inside when multiples are being called. <br />
              
              
              
              
          <br />
          <strong>Communication with the other PT<br />
                
          </strong><br />If a ref ever turns in and makes a call into the group in the middle, while pts have different teams, they should never adopt the mindset ‘not my team’. Take calls for the other team when needed and immediately pass it on to the other tracker. <br />
              
          <br />
          <strong>Duties<br />
                
          </strong><br />Do Numbers check on skaters before the bouts when refs are doing equip checks.  ensure they have the same number shown on the roster and they are up to rules.  Example of non approved number - Rx80 on the jeresy, x being smaller than the regulation size.  Her arm needs to read R80, and cannot have the x.  Notify the head ref, your head nso or THNSO if a skater is not in compliance and won’t or can’t change it. <br /><br />
          <strong>Read up on uniform and official numbers rules<br />
          </strong><br />
          Carry over penalties on the new sheet at the end of period 1.  All penalties are carried over. <br />
              
              
          <br />
        </p>
        <h1>Inside White Board</h1>
        Basic expectations:<br /><br />
      <li>Work a board displaying both teams total minors and majors counts.<br />
  <li>Minors will always be shown up to 4.  When 4 is reached it is a final talley mark on the minor side until the skater sits, and then it is a ‘4’ on the majors side.<br />
    Majors 
    
    will be will be shown with the appropriate penalty code related to the infratction<br />
  </li>
<li>Board should be in skater same order as the PT sheets have them.<br />
        
<li>Board shows # of time outs used by both teams. (Jam timer, be on it showing who is calling the time out, make sure IWB knows)  Have the TO displayed as hollow circles that are filled in as they are used. <br />
<li>Board shows # of official reviews used by both teams <br /><br />(Refs - please be sure to tell the inside crew if a Team time out turned into an official review and if the time out is still charged as well.)<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Communication with PTs</strong><br />
        
 <li>CONFIRM!  When a pt gives you info for the board, verbally confirm you got it.<br />
<li>Watch skaters going to the box, esp if they got called for the 4th minor, and when they sit, move the penalty over to the majors side and say out loud that skater is now sitting.<br />
<br /><br />
      <h1>Wrangler</h1>
      Basic Expectations<br />
<li>Be a versatile bridge of communication between the inside NSO crew and the ref crews. <br />
      <li>You MAY wear color tape on either wrist to communicate which team a ref is trying to signal, if needed. <br />
        
      <li>See PT area for more details on styles of wrangling. <br />
<li>Confirm loudly to any refs when you know you are the only one getting  a call picked up.<br />
<li>WAIT and see if your pts are getting calls before yelling them back to them. <br />
<li>Be prepared to help PTs find out what the number is of a skater in the box, chase down a ref in the 30 sec between jams and ask what that call on skater 44 was, etc.<br />
<li>TALK with your ref AND NSO crew ahead of each bout to get a feel for what kind of wrangler they both need and find a compromise. <br />
 <br /><br />
      <h1>Outside White Board</h1>
      Basic Expectations<br />
<li>Be alert and ready to write penalties down from OPRs<br />
<li>Hold the board displaying the penalty into the middle for a PT/IWB/Wrangler to see<br />
<li>Wait for a thumbs up from someone before erasing<br />
<li>Use penalty codes used on PT sheets<br />
<li>Circle the Penalty code if it’s a major<br />
<li>Hold the board down and to the side when not showing a call<br />
<li>When writing a penalty, hold the board at an angle so the inside crew can see which team side you are writing on, and can make sure to have the right tracker paying attention sooner. <br />

<br /><br />
      <h1>Jam Timer</h1>
      Basic Expectations<br />
      <br />Work closely with the head ref and the scoreboard<br />
        
      <li>Confirm with the head ref who is allowed to call an official time out<br />
<li>Confirm what to do if the head ref or any other refs are not on the track when the jam is ready to start.<br />
<li>You will be using a period timer as well as timing the jams. (2 watches)<br />
<li>Official time outs MAY or MAY NOT be whistled and stopped on the period clock until the 30 seconds has elapsed.  Check with your head ref! <br />
<li>When calling a time out, blow 4 short whistles as you step out onto the track signaling the time out<br />
<li>When a time out is over do a rolling whistle to indicate it to everyone.<br />
        
        <br />Starting the jam<br />
        
<li>At 5 seconds till starting yell ‘FIVE SECONDS’ raise your hand up in the air.  Do not count down on the hand, but keep it raised.<br />
          
<li>At the appropriate time blow the whistle and chop hand down towards the pack.  Hold hand out towards the pack entire time until they have passed the pivot line.<br />
          
<li>In times of no pack or pack is front, wait for the refs to give verbal and physical cues before blowing the jammer starts <br /><br /><br />
          
<li>As soon as the pack has passed the pivot line, blow the 2 whistles and sweep outstretched hand towards the jammers.<br /></li>
